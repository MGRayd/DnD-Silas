???+ note "TL;DR"
    _Discussion about days of week, character creation and lore._

---

### Highlights
 - We are currently sitting at 6 players, willing to go up to 8 but it is first come first serve so private message on Discord if you want to play and if there is a space you've got it.
- We are going to meet every two weeks, same as 40k meetup weeks. It is going to alternate with a Thursday meeting one week and Sunday after 40k two weeks later.
- Thursday meetings will be online starting at 6pm (probably through discord video chat), Sunday sessions will be in person at Board in the City, starting at 5pm.
- This is a Homebrew game, we are playing 2024 rules and a Discord channel setup with some information about the setting and history of the world.
