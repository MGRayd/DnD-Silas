# Back Story

Silas Corvin was born in a frontier town on the edge of nowhere, a place where the law was thin, and the night was thick with things best left unnamed. Folks there lived by the gun, the blade, or the bottle, and most didn’t live long.

One night, the kind of night when the wind itself seemed to whisper, something came crawling out of the dark. Silas was young, but he still remembers the screams, his mother’s first, his father’s last, and the cold certainty that steel alone couldn’t stop what stalked their home. He survived, but survival left him with more scars than he cared to count.

Years later, he sought out the Blood Hunters, grim folk who bind their own life’s blood to forbidden rites. Silas learned their ways, and in time he made them his own, fusing the tradition of the hunter with the quickdraw grit of his homeland. His crossbows strike faster than most men can blink, and every bolt hums with the storm he calls into it.

Now, Silas is a wanderer. He drifts from town to town, leaving only silence and burning corpses behind. Some call him cursed, others call him necessary. He doesn’t argue either way.

## Character Intro

_The man who walks into camp is no local. His coat is worn, his boots scuffed from miles of dust and stone, and his eyes catch the firelight in an unsettling crimson glow. Twin crossbows hang low at his hips, like an extension of his hands. He tips his hat in greeting, the gesture polite but distant.

_"Name’s Silas Corvin,"_ he says, voice low and rough. _"I ain’t from these parts. Don’t much matter where. What matters is this, I hunt things folk’d rather pretend don’t exist. And if your path takes you into the kind of dark I think it will… well, maybe you’ll be glad to have me along."

## Character Traits

### Bond
- I swore an oath to never let an innocent fall the way my parents did. Wherever the unnatural rises, I will be there to put it down.
- My crossbows are heirlooms of my family. They are all I have left of them, and I would kill to keep them safe.

### Ideal

- **Redemption.** No one is beyond saving, not even those cursed by blood or shadow. If I can cling to my humanity, so can they.
- **Duty.** My strength is not mine to keep; it is a burden I bear for those who cannot fight for themselves.

### Flaw

- I keep everyone at a distance. I may fight beside strangers and even share a drink with them, but I will not let them close. Trust is a crack in the armour, and every time I’ve let someone in, I’ve lost them.
- I carry guilt like a shadow. When I see families together, it only reminds me of what I failed to protect.

### Secret

- I tell others I chose this path, but the truth is I had nothing left. When my family was gone, I begged the Blood Hunters to take me in. They did, but only because I offered everything, my blood, my future, and my humanity. What I fear most is that, without the hunt, there is nothing left of me at all.
- Each time I bleed for the rite, I feel something stir beneath my skin, as if my blood is not entirely my own. I tell myself it is the cost of power, but in quiet moments I wonder if the hunt is awakening something I will not be able to contain.
