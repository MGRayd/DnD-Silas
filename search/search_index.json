The disappearance of the mists has allowed entry into lands that were cut off from the rest of the world for over a century prior. In those years, bold settlers, soldiers, and seekers of fortune have pressed into its borders, raising towns upon ruins, charting forests once cloaked in secrecy, and daring the wilds where strange beasts and older magic's stir. Yet for all their efforts, most of Terraveil remains uncharted, and whispers speak of ancient powers, forgotten vaults, and kingdoms lost to both fire and fog. You are among those who would set foot where few dare tread \u2014 whether for glory, gold, knowledge, or reasons of your own. The roads into Terraveil are perilous, but the promise of discovery calls louder still. The mists may be gone, but mystery lingers, and fate waits for those bold enough to carve their story into the bones of this wild land.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/","title":"Campaign","text":""},{"location":"campaigns/#campaign-calendar","title":"Campaign Calendar","text":""},{"location":"campaigns/#campaign-log","title":"Campaign Log","text":"<p>A chronological index of our Terraveil sessions.</p> <ul> <li>31-08-2025 \u2014 Session 0 Discussed campaign dates, characters and lore. \u2192 Read</li> <li>11-09-2025 \u2014 Session 1 Our tale has not yet begun, but the pieces are moving\u2026 \u2192 Read</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/Session-0/","title":"2025-08-31 \u2013 Session 0","text":"TL;DR <p>Discussion about days of week, character creation and lore.</p>","tags":["session","terraveil"]},{"location":"campaigns/Session-0/#highlights","title":"Highlights","text":"<ul> <li>We are currently sitting at 6 players, willing to go up to 8 but it is first come first serve so private message on Discord if you want to play and if there is a space you've got it.</li> <li>We are going to meet every two weeks, same as 40k meetup weeks.

Silas was young, but he still remembers the screams, his mother\u2019s first, his father\u2019s last, and the cold certainty that steel alone couldn\u2019t stop what stalked their home. He survived, but survival left him with more scars than he cared to count.</p> <p>Years later, he sought out the Blood Hunters, grim folk who bind their own life\u2019s blood to forbidden rites. Silas learned their ways, and in time he made them his own, fusing the tradition of the hunter with the quickdraw grit of his homeland. His crossbows strike faster than most men can blink, and every bolt hums with the storm he calls into it.</p> <p>Now, Silas is a wanderer.
